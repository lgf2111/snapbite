# SnapBite

A Telegram-native, low-friction, AI-assisted food & nutrition logging app.

> Formerly **FoodLog**, now fully rebranded to **SnapBite** — including a new bot (`@SnapBiteAI_bot`) and renamed infrastructure (`snapbite-worker`, `snapbite` Pages, `snapbite-db`, `@snapbite/*` packages). Existing FoodLog users are migrated over.

**One-line goal:** unlock phone → open SnapBite (or just send a photo to the bot) → AI analyzes it → confirm/correct → saved.

Nutrition is always shown as an **estimate** and is always **editable**. The AI runs on **your own API key** (BYOK), so running costs are ~$0 beyond a few hundredths of a cent per photo.

## How it works

Send a photo of a meal to the Telegram bot. The Cloudflare Worker downloads it, calls a vision model (your key) to identify foods, portions, and rough nutrition, saves the meal (keeping the photo via its Telegram `file_id`), and replies. If the photo shows a **nutrition-facts label**, the model reads it and uses those exact values; if it can read a **product barcode**, the digits are looked up in [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) and the product's exact per-100g nutrition (scaled to the serving) replaces the estimate; otherwise it estimates from appearance.

**Beta update broadcasts:** an admin-only `/broadcast` command sends the current changelog (see `packages/core/src/version/version.ts`) to all users, framed as beta with frequent updates. To avoid spamming inactive users, if a user's previous update message is still within Telegram's ~48h edit window it's **edited in place** to the newest version instead of sending a new message.

**Admin alerts → group topics:** when `ADMIN_GROUP_CHAT_ID` (a negative supergroup id) is set, error/feedback/broadcast alerts post into that group's forum **Topics** (`ERRORS_THREAD_ID`, `FEEDBACK_THREAD_ID`, `BROADCAST_THREAD_ID`) instead of DMing the owner — keeping the owner's personal 1:1 chat for their own logging. Falls back to DMing `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID` when no group is configured. Add the bot to the group so it can post.

**Resilient photo logging:** if a photo analysis hits a sustained model overload (503) that survives the inline retries and any fallback provider, the photo is **queued and auto-re-analyzed** by the cron a few minutes later (up to 2 attempts) — the "busy" message is edited in place into the result on success, so the user never has to resend. If the model's *first* reply can't be parsed into the expected shape (bad JSON or a schema mismatch), the provider adapter automatically retries **once** with a short corrective nudge before giving up, which recovers most one-off formatting slips without a resend. A deterministic resolver prefers a bundled per-100g table and falls back to the AI estimate, tagging every value's source (`table` / `ai_estimate` / `manual` / `mixed`). Per-food nutrition (kcal + protein/carbs/fat for every food) is persisted and read back verbatim, so multi-food meals keep each food's macros. In the Mini App you review, edit, search, and analyze — all computed from stored rows in SQL, no AI calls. A **generous per-user photo rate limit** (up to 40 logged photos per rolling hour, a single indexed `COUNT` on the meals table — no extra table or dependency) guards against a flood of photos running up D1 writes and Telegram downloads; well above any real meal cadence, and it never touches your existing meals.

**Logging is done through the Telegram bot:** send a photo to the bot chat and it auto-logs the AI's estimate, keeps the photo (free, via the Telegram `file_id`), and replies with an "Open" button. **You can also log by text** — describe a meal in plain words ("two eggs, sourdough, half an avocado") and it runs through the same analysis pipeline (BYOK, no photo). An explicit **`log …`** / `ate …` / `had …` prefix always logs a *new* meal; a plain message when you have no recent meal is also treated as a new meal; otherwise plain text revises your last meal (below). The single "📸 Analyzing your meal…" message is **edited in place** into the result, so the chat stays one message per meal instead of a growing thread. If you've set a goal, the confirmation also appends one **deterministic goal-progress line** (e.g. "📊 96g protein today — 54g to your goal", leading with protein and falling back to calories, celebrating when you hit it) — computed from your logged meals + targets with no AI, and omitted entirely for users without a profile. **Reply to a logged meal (or just send a message right after) with a change in plain words** — e.g. "add a coke", "the rice was double" — and the bot re-runs the AI, updates the meal, and edits the confirmation in place. If you logged several meals in the last few minutes it asks you to reply to the specific one. The **Mini App** is for reviewing, editing, searching, and analyzing your logged meals, and you can also **add a meal by hand** there (name + macros, no photo or AI key needed). **Re-log a saved meal from chat:** star a meal in the Mini App to save it, then send **`/saved`** to the bot to see your saved meals numbered, and **`/saved 1`** (etc.) to log one again instantly — no photo, no AI call, since the saved meal keeps the full result. **Ask the coach:** **`/coach <question>`** answers a nutrition question from the user's own logged data — the Worker builds a tiny CONTEXT (today's + this week's totals, their targets, a recent-meal count; summaries, never raw history) and the model answers in 1–3 sentences on the user's own key via a plain-text (non-JSON) completion. On-demand only (a command, so no background cost), anchored to the user's data and nutrition — not a general chatbot, and it declines medical/clinical questions. **Set up by chat:** new users can send **`/setup`** to the bot and answer a few questions (sex, date of birth, height, weight, activity, goal) to get their daily calorie + macro targets — no Mini App needed. `/cancel` exits. If a profile already exists, `/setup` **seeds each step from it** and shows the current value with a *reply `keep` to leave it* hint, so returning users only change what they want. The flow keeps per-user state in `preferences_json` and is intercepted before the plain-text "revise last meal" handler. The profile stores a **`birthDate`** rather than a fixed age, so age (and the targets derived from it) auto-update as birthdays pass; profiles saved before this change that only have `age` keep working (age is used as-is).

**Opt-in meal reminders** (Settings) send a Telegram nudge at times you choose, in your local timezone — breakfast, lunch, and dinner each have their own toggle and time, and edits are batched behind a "Save changes" button. Any time works; a 15-minute cron just controls how often the Worker checks, so a reminder fires within ~15 min of its set time. The stored timezone offset self-heals: whenever you open the app, if your device's offset changed (travel/DST) it's silently refreshed so the next reminder fires at the right local time.

## Architecture

Monorepo (pnpm workspaces):

- **`packages/core`** — transport-agnostic domain logic: Zod schemas, the `AIProvider` interface + a generic OpenAI-compatible adapter with provider presets (Gemini, OpenAI, DeepSeek), prompt builder, nutrition resolver + bundled table, Telegram `initData` verification, bot update parsing, AES-GCM crypto. Zero platform imports; the reason a future Telegram-native port is cheap.
- **`apps/worker`** — Cloudflare Worker (Hono) + D1 (Drizzle ORM). Auth via Telegram `initData` HMAC, encrypted BYOK, meal analyze/save/CRUD, history/search/analytics, and the bot webhook.
- **`apps/miniapp`** — React + Vite Mini App (`@telegram-apps/sdk-react`), UI built with **shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4**, hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Reviews/edits/searches/analyzes logged meals (logging itself is done via the bot). The Telegram theme drives the shadcn color tokens at runtime. Falls back to localStorage when no backend is configured (browser dev); on load it runs a one-time migration of any pre-rebrand `foodlog.*` keys to the `snapbite.*` namespace. **Accessibility:** icon-only buttons carry `aria-label`s, decorative emojis/icons are `aria-hidden`, the macro figures expose a spoken label (e.g. "30 grams protein") instead of raw emoji, and each progress ring is a labelled `role="img"`. Biome's a11y lints are clean; full WCAG conformance still needs manual assistive-technology testing and expert review.
- **`apps/cli`** — local harness to run a photo through the pipeline end-to-end (mock by default, real provider via `--real`).

**Security:** the AI key is stored AES-256-GCM encrypted in D1 (ciphertext + IV), decrypted in-memory per request, never returned or logged. Image bytes transit but are not persisted; only the Telegram `file_id` is kept (for bot photos). All meal data is owner-scoped.

## Develop

Requires Node 20+ and pnpm.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r test         # run all tests (Vitest; Worker tests use Miniflare D1)
pnpm -r typecheck    # typecheck every package
pnpm -r build        # build all packages
```

Run one workspace, e.g. the Worker locally:

```bash
pnpm --filter @snapbite/worker dev          # wrangler dev (local D1)
pnpm --filter @snapbite/miniapp dev         # Vite dev server (mock mode without VITE_WORKER_URL)
```

Try the pipeline from the CLI:

```bash
pnpm --filter @snapbite/cli build
node apps/cli/dist/index.js path/to/meal.jpg            # mock provider
node --env-file=.env apps/cli/dist/index.js meal.jpg --real   # real provider (needs a key)
```

## Configuration & secrets

Secrets are never committed. Local files are gitignored.

- **Root `.env`** — `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` (or other provider key) for CLI/real tests.
- **`apps/worker/.dev.vars`** — local Worker secrets: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (base64 of 32 bytes), `MINI_APP_URL`, `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID` (your numeric Telegram id; gates admin bot commands + error/feedback alerts — optional, storage works without it).
- **`apps/miniapp` build** — `VITE_WORKER_URL` points the app at the deployed Worker (empty = mock mode).

Production secrets are set with `wrangler secret put` and are not stored in the repo.

## Deploy (Cloudflare, free tier)

```bash
# One-time
wrangler login
wrangler d1 create snapbite-db        # put the id in apps/worker/wrangler.toml
wrangler d1 migrations apply snapbite-db --remote
# Set secrets: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, ENCRYPTION_KEY, MINI_APP_URL, TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET
# Optional: ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID (your numeric Telegram id) to enable /errors, /feedback review, and alerts

# Worker
pnpm --filter @snapbite/worker exec wrangler deploy

# Mini App (Pages)
VITE_WORKER_URL=https://<worker-url> pnpm --filter @snapbite/miniapp build
pnpm --filter @snapbite/miniapp exec wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=snapbite

# Bot: register the webhook (with the secret) via the Telegram Bot API. The Mini App is set as
# the bot's Main Mini App in BotFather, so it launches from the bot profile's "Open App" button
# (no separate chat menu button needed).

# Bot command menu (the `/` autocomplete): registers /start, /settings, /feedback, /help.
# Admin-only /errors and /feedback-review are intentionally NOT listed (gated by ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID).
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<your-bot-token> pnpm --filter @snapbite/worker bot:commands
# (or drop the token in a gitignored .bot-token file at the repo root and run the command without it)
```

## AI providers

SnapBite is provider-agnostic. Pick a provider and paste your key in **Settings**:

- **Google Gemini** (default, recommended) — best food-vision value; free tier at aistudio.google.com. Default model `gemini-3.6-flash` (Gemini rotates/retires model names; override in Settings if needed).
- **OpenAI** — `gpt-4o-mini` by default; strong and reliable.
- **DeepSeek** — cheapest; weaker at food recognition.

All three are called through the same OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions shape; only the base URL, model, and whether `image_url.detail` is honored differ. Image detail defaults to `high` for better recognition. The model is overridable per user (versions rotate).

**Free-tier limits & fallback.** Provider free tiers are rate-limited — e.g. Gemini's free tier allows roughly 20 requests/day on `gemini-3.6-flash` plus a per-minute cap, and returns a "quota exceeded" (429) error once hit; models can also be temporarily "overloaded" (503), or a key can hit a **billing/credit** problem (402, e.g. "prepayment credits are needed"). Settings surfaces this, and you can configure a **fallback provider** (OpenAI/`gpt-4o-mini` recommended — most accurate for food): if the primary hits a rate-limit, overload, or billing error while logging a photo, the Worker automatically fails over to the fallback (after retrying a transient 503 "overloaded" on the primary a few times with backoff). The fallback lives behind a toggle in Settings — turning it **off keeps the stored key** (only "Remove" deletes it). Each logged meal records which provider actually analyzed it (shown on the meal card and detail), and the bot's photo reply summarizes the interpreted foods plus estimated calories/protein/carbs/fat (and fiber when the analysis produced it). The fallback key is encrypted at rest like the primary and stored in `preferences_json`.

**Observability & feedback.** Errors that hit real users are written to a durable D1 `error_logs` table (source, kind, HTTP-ish status, message, and a redacted detail snippet — never keys). The cron sweeps rows older than 30 days (one best-effort `DELETE`) so the table stays small and well within the free tier. Logging is best-effort and never blocks a user's reply, and it mirrors to `console.error` so `wrangler tail` still shows things live. Users can report problems two ways: `/feedback <message>` in the bot, or a **Send feedback** dialog in the Mini App Settings — both store to a D1 `feedback` table. If `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID` is set, the owner gets a Telegram DM on user-facing photo/webhook failures and on new feedback, and can run admin-only `/errors` and `/feedback` (no args) commands to review the latest entries. An admin-only `/ping` routes a sample alert through the same `adminNotify` path (into the errors Topic, or the owner DM when no group is set) so the owner can confirm alerts are actually being delivered end-to-end. External trackers (e.g. Sentry) are intentionally skipped for now; `logError` is the single choke-point where one could be added later.

### Getting an API key

You bring your own key. Create one with whichever provider you want, then paste it in **SnapBite → Settings → AI provider** (and optionally as your **Fallback provider**). A key is stored encrypted and only used server-side.

**Google Gemini** (recommended default)
1. Go to [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and sign in with a Google account.
2. Click **Create API key** (Google AI Studio auto-creates a Cloud project for new users, or pick one).
3. Copy the key and paste it into Settings; keep provider **Gemini**.
- Free tier works out of the box but is limited (see below). To lift limits, enable billing on the key's Google Cloud project.

**OpenAI** (recommended fallback — most accurate for food)
1. Go to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and sign in.
2. Click **Create new secret key**, then copy it (you can only view it once).
3. Add a payment method under **Settings → Billing** — OpenAI's API has no free tier, so a key without credit returns a `402` billing error.
4. Paste the key into Settings and choose provider **OpenAI** (default model `gpt-4o-mini`).

**DeepSeek** (cheapest)
1. Go to [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com) and sign up.
2. Open **API keys** in the sidebar and click **Create new API key**; copy it immediately.
3. Add credit in the console (DeepSeek is pay-as-you-go; an unfunded key returns an insufficient-balance error).
4. Paste the key into Settings and choose provider **DeepSeek**.

> Tip: pair a **Gemini** primary (free) with an **OpenAI** fallback so photo logging keeps working when the Gemini free tier is exhausted.

### How daily targets are calculated

When you set a goal in onboarding/Settings, SnapBite computes daily calorie and macro targets deterministically (no AI) — all in [`packages/core/src/profile/profile.ts`](packages/core/src/profile/profile.ts). These are estimates and can be overridden in **Advanced** mode.

1. **BMR** (Basal Metabolic Rate) via the **Mifflin–St Jeor** equation ([Mifflin et al., 1990, *Am J Clin Nutr*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2305711/)):
   - Men: `BMR = 10·kg + 6.25·cm − 5·age + 5`
   - Women: `BMR = 10·kg + 6.25·cm − 5·age − 161`
2. **TDEE** (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) = `BMR × activity factor`:
   | Activity | Factor |
   |---|---|
   | Sedentary | 1.2 |
   | Light (1–3×/wk) | 1.375 |
   | Moderate (3–5×/wk) | 1.55 |
   | Active (6–7×/wk) | 1.725 |
   | Very active | 1.9 |
3. **Calorie target** = `TDEE × goal factor`, rounded to the nearest 10 kcal and floored at **1200 kcal**. The goal is a 5-stage slider:
   - Lose fast `× 0.75` · Lose steady `× 0.88` · Maintain `× 1.00` · Lean gain `× 1.10` · Gain fast `× 1.20`
4. **Macros** (whole grams):
   - **Protein** = `1.8 g × bodyweight(kg)` (mid of the commonly cited 1.6–2.2 g/kg range)
   - **Fat** = `25% of calories ÷ 9`
   - **Carbs** = remaining calories `÷ 4` (after protein + fat), floored at 0

In **Advanced** mode, an explicit calorie target and/or macro grams override the computed values. Body metrics are stored canonically in kg/cm; imperial (lb/ft-in) is a display preference and doesn't change the result.

## Status

The full core build (Tasks 1–12) is done and deployed, plus full CRUD, editable macros, bot-photo auto-log, and photos-in-logs. Multi-provider AI (Gemini / OpenAI / DeepSeek) with in-app provider + model selection is live. Privacy & data control shipped: **export** your data (`GET /api/account/export` → downloadable JSON; the encrypted API key is never included) and **delete** your account (`DELETE /api/account`, cascading to all meals/photos/settings), both surfaced in Settings alongside a plain-language privacy explanation.

The Mini App (shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4, Telegram theming, native buttons + haptics) is a focused two-tab app: **Home** and **Settings**. Home is a day view — a clickable calendar to pick any day, that day's totals, and its meals; each meal supports **swipe-left-to-delete** and **"Update with AI"**. Update-with-AI is a review-before-save flow: describe a change in plain words ("add a can of coke", "the rice was double"), the AI drafts the revised meal (`POST /api/meals/:id/revise`, no persistence), you review it — AI-removed foods show as "will be removed" with Undo — and save when it looks right. The History, Search, and Stats tabs (and their endpoints) were removed. Screens are code-split (`React.lazy`) and Home fetches only the selected day (`GET /api/meals?date=` + `GET /api/meals/dates`) for a fast first load. The date-picker calendar (`react-day-picker`, ~73 kB) is itself lazy-loaded only when the calendar popover opens, so it stays out of the Home first-paint bundle. The weekly view fetches just its range server-side (`GET /api/meals?from=&to=`, inclusive local-day keys) rather than pulling the whole history and filtering in the browser.

**Goals & daily targets.** A skippable onboarding collects your profile (sex, date of birth, height, weight, activity, goal) and computes daily calorie + macro targets using the **Mifflin-St Jeor** BMR equation × activity factor, adjusted by a **5-stage goal slider** (Lose fast −25% / Lose steady −12% / Maintain / Lean gain +10% / Gain fast +20%); protein at 1.8 g/kg, fat at 25% of calories, carbs from the remainder. Metric (kg/cm) or imperial (lb/ft-in) units, and a **simple/advanced** toggle for manual calorie/macro overrides. Home then shows **progress rings** for calories, protein, carbs, and fat remaining for the selected day. The **Weekly** view aggregates the range and has a **Total / Daily avg** toggle — "Total" sums the seven days against a weekly target, "Daily avg" divides both by the number of days so you can compare a typical day to your daily target (computed client-side from the already-fetched range; the choice is remembered in localStorage). Profile lives in `preferences_json` (no schema migration) and is editable in Settings. Skipping onboarding is a first-class path: the profile step's "Skip for now — I'll just start logging" and Home's optional-goal card make clear that logging already works without a profile — only the progress rings wait for a goal.

**Adaptive targets (opt-in).** The fixed Mifflin-St Jeor target is only an estimate of maintenance energy; everyone's real burn differs. When a user opts in (`PUT /api/settings/adaptive`) and logs their weight now and then — `/weight 72.5`, or a bare `72.5 kg` / `158 lb` message, stored as a small time series in `preferences_json` (no schema change, capped) — a weekly cron pass (`runAdaptiveCheckins`) measures their *actual* TDEE deterministically: it smooths the weigh-ins into a trend (time-aware EMA), then backs out `TDEE ≈ avg daily intake − (trendΔkg × 7700 kcal/kg) ÷ days` over the window (intake from the already-stored meal rows via `sumMealsSince`). It then nudges the calorie target toward `measuredTDEE × goalFactor` — damped (moves part-way) and clamped (≤150 kcal/week) so one noisy window can't overcorrect, floored at 1200 — writing it as an advanced `calorieTargetOverride` and DMing a one-line check-in. Gated behind an opt-in and ≥3 weigh-ins spanning ≥7 days with enough logged intake; it never runs more than once per local week. No AI, no new dependency, no server-side model cost — all arithmetic over data the app already has (`packages/core/src/profile/expenditure.ts`). The plain fixed target stays the default until adaptive is turned on.

**Streaks & weekly recap.** Two deterministic, no-AI motivation touches built on logged-day math (`packages/core/src/stats`). A **logging streak** counts consecutive days ending today *or* yesterday — so logging in the evening never breaks a run that was alive through yesterday — and is appended to each log confirmation once it reaches 2+ days (`🔥 N-day logging streak`, with a `🎉` at every multiple of 7). The **weekly recap** is opt-in (`PUT /api/settings/recap`, stored as `recap` in `preferences_json`, no schema change): a cron pass (`runWeeklyRecaps`) fires on the user's **local Sunday** — deduped by `localWeekKey` so it sends at most once per week — and DMs a short summary of the week they logged (days logged, average calories & protein, protein-target hit count, best day, current streak), computed from `mealRowsSince` bucketed into local day-keys. Both are pure date/number math on the user's own data (no AI, no server-side model cost), and the recap query stays within the free-tier cron.

**Provider & model selection.** In Settings, the **model** is a dropdown of each provider's known-good vision models (guards against typos and retired names), with a **Custom…** option that reveals a free-text field for brand-new model names. A **Custom (advanced)** provider option lets power users point at any OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint by base URL + model (with an image-`detail` toggle) — available for both the primary and fallback provider. When you send a photo, the bot shows an "Analyzing your meal…" acknowledgement while it works. Meal day-grouping follows your device's local time.
