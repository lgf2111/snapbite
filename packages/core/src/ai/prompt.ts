Respond with a single valid JSON object and nothing else — no markdown, no code fences, no commentary. The JSON must match this shape exactly:

{
  "title": "Chicken rice",
  "foods": [
    {
      "name": "short food name",
      "estimatedWeightG": 150,
      "portion": "human-readable portion, e.g. '1 bowl'",
      "quantity": 1,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "aiNutrition": { "energyKcal": 200, "proteinG": 8, "carbsG": 30, "fatG": 5, "fiberG": 2 },
      "barcode": "optional digits if a product barcode is clearly readable"
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "needsConfirmation": false,
  "notes": "optional short note about anything uncertain"
}

Rules:
- "title" is a SHORT, natural meal name of 2–4 words that a person would use, e.g. "Chicken rice", "Egg & toast", "Blueberry oats". NOT a description or a list — keep it under ~24 characters, no "Identified as", no sentence.
- Every field is required for each food. Never leave "name" empty or omit "estimatedWeightG".
- "estimatedWeightG" is the realistic total weight in grams of that food as visible (a number > 0).
- "aiNutrition" is your best rough estimate of that food's nutrition PER 100 GRAMS (not per portion): energyKcal, proteinG, carbsG, fatG, all numbers >= 0. Also include "fiberG" (dietary fiber per 100 g, a number >= 0) when you can reasonably estimate it; omit it only if you truly can't.
- "quantity" is how many of that item are present (default 1).
- Identify real, specific foods (e.g. "grilled chicken breast", "steamed white rice"), not "unknown food", whenever the image shows food.
- If the image is unclear, ambiguous, or not food, still return your single best guess, set needsConfirmation to true, and lower confidence — but keep all numeric fields filled with realistic estimates, never zeros.

Choosing the nutrition source (in priority order):
1. NUTRITION LABEL: If a nutrition-facts panel / ingredients label is visible, READ IT and use those exact values. Convert whatever basis the label uses (per serving, per package, per 100 g) into "aiNutrition" PER 100 GRAMS, and set "estimatedWeightG" to the amount actually being eaten (e.g. the serving or package size shown). Use the product name from the label as "name". Set confidence high (>= 0.9) and add a short "notes" like "from nutrition label".
2. BARCODE / QR CODE: If you can clearly read the digits printed under a product barcode (EAN/UPC, usually 8–13 digits), put ONLY those digits in that food's "barcode" field — they'll be looked up for exact nutrition. Do NOT guess or invent digits; omit "barcode" if you can't read them confidently. Also use any readable product name/brand for "name". If the packaging has a nutrition label too, still follow rule 1 for the estimate.
3. VISUAL ESTIMATE: Otherwise, estimate nutrition from the food's appearance as usual.`;

- Start from the provided meal and change only what the instruction asks. Keep foods and their values that the instruction does not mention.
- To add a food, append it with realistic estimates for every field. To remove one, drop it. To change a portion/quantity, adjust "estimatedWeightG"/"quantity" accordingly.
- Every field is required for each remaining food; never leave "name" empty or omit "estimatedWeightG".
- "estimatedWeightG" is the realistic total weight in grams of that food (a number > 0).
- "aiNutrition" is your best rough estimate of that food's nutrition PER 100 GRAMS (not per portion): energyKcal, proteinG, carbsG, fatG, all numbers >= 0. Include "fiberG" (per 100 g, >= 0) when you reasonably can.
- "quantity" is how many of that item are present (default 1).
- If the result would have no foods, return your best single-food guess and set needsConfirmation to true.`;
